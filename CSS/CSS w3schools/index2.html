        <h1>Blockchain</h1>
        <p>Blockchain defined: Blockchain is a shared, immutable ledger that facilitates the process of
           recording transactions and tracking assets in a business network. An asset can be tangible
           (a house, car, cash, land) or intangible (intellectual property, patents, copyrights, branding).
           Virtually anything of value can be tracked and traded on a blockchain network, reducing risk and
           cutting costs for all involved.

        <p>Why blockchain is important: Business runs on information. The faster itâ€™s received and the more
           accurate it is, the better. Blockchain is ideal for delivering that information because it provides
           immediate, shared and completely transparent information stored on an immutable ledger that can be
           accessed only by permissioned network members. A blockchain network can track orders, payments,
           accounts, production and much more. And because members share a single view of the truth, you can
           see all details of a transaction end to end, giving you greater confidence, as well as new
           efficiencies and opportunities.</p>
